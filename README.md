Repository for audiovisual equipment deck repair and maintenance. Made with love by AV archivists &lt;3



This is a repository to compile resources for audiovisual equipment deck repair and maintenance. Much of the decks that AV archivists use in the field for digitization purposes must also be maintained and taken care of like our loved ones. While we support and appreciate our vendors and technicians who fix these decks for us, it's also great to have autonomy and learn how to fix many simple issues ourselves! Further, we can't always afford to send out our decks to be fixed, so this is another way that we can help support each other and share knowledge.

This repository will provide resources such as manuals, common issues and how-to-fix them, links to videos, and links to parts!
